# GenomicsCodingTest

Basic coding test for Genomics Aotearoa Genome Graphs project positions.

## Instructions:

Generate a reproducible workflow (e.g., shell script, R markdown file, iPython notebook) that accomplishes the following:

1. Download BAM file of aligned nanopore data: LINK

2. Output the total number of reads in the file

3. Produce a histogram of read lengths

4. Count the number of reads that are longer than 10kb

5. Calculate the average Phred quality score for each read, and display these averages for the first ten reads.
