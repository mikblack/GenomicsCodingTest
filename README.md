# Genomics Coding Test

Basic coding test for Genomics Aotearoa Genome Graphs project position.

## Instructions:

Generate a reproducible workflow (e.g., a shell script, R markdown file, or Jupyter notebook) that accomplishes the following:

1. Download BAM file of aligned Oxford Nanopore sequence data: [BAM file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikblack/GenomicsCodingTest/main/ont-reads-aligned.bam)

2. Output the total number of reads in the file

3. Produce a histogram of read lengths

4. Count the number of reads that are longer than 10kb

5. Calculate the average Phred quality score for each read, and output these averages for the first ten reads.

Once you have completed the task, please email an appropriate file (e.g., .sh, .Rmd, .ipynb) and the outut that it produces (in html or pdf format)
